          We believe that climate-tech startups have the power to make a
          significant positive social impact on a large scale. We want to help
          these startups get on their feet, faster. That's why we're investing
          â‚¬50.000 in a startup fund, providing promising pioneers with the tools
          they need to push their mission further.

        <h2>Who's behind this?</h2>
        <p>
          GRRR is a creative digital agency for Meaningful Matters. We strive to
          make the world cleaner, fairer and more colourful, and have been
          working towards this mission for over 20 years now. We were the first
          Dutch digital creative agency with a B-Corp certificate, and our focus
          on impact strategy, inclusive design and ethical tech has been
          recognised with 33 international awards and nominations. Seeing our
          work realised in the success of companies like The Ocean Cleanup (with
          xx result), Fastned (with xx result) and SkyNRG (with xx result) is
          what keeps us going.

        <h2>What's the fund?</h2>
        <p>
          The startup fund was born from our mission: helping all organisations
          become more meaningful, regardless of where they're at on their impact
          journey. We took this one step further and pledged to fund
          climate-tech startups that deserve quality but can't afford it (yet).

        <h2>Good design for a better planet?</h2>
        <p>
          Design goes beyond what looks nice. It's your brand's personality; how
          it looks, talks, reacts and interacts with people. Good design can
          make a brand easier to understand, to use, more memorable and more
          accessible. It gets your mission across and your message out there.
          That's why we're funding climate-tech startups; we want to give them
          the power to stand out, to make even more impact, to be even more
          successful, and ultimately, to build towards a more sustainable
          future.

        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>
          You'll enter the brand-pressure-cooker, a fast-paced brand immersion,
          together with our team of brand identity experts. We'll guide you
          through the process of (re)defining your mission and messaging,
          followed by visualising your brand, over the following four phases:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Phase One: Brand Strategy</li>
          <li>Phase Two: Visual Identity</li>
          <li>
            Phase Three: Communication Tools (pitch deck, storyline, tone of
            voice guidelines)
          </li>
          <li>Phase Four: One page Website</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          At the end of the process you'll be armed with a clear mission,
          messaging and a design arsenal tailored for results.

        <h2>Who's eligible?</h2>
        <p>
          Applications are open to climate-tech companies who are on the early
          stage of their startup journey. Applicants will be assessed based on
          the questions answered in the application form, but must also be able
          to:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Provide input and feedback</li>
          <li>Be available to invest time in the process</li>
          <li>Be agile and willing to work under high pressure</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          We'd like to ensure the fund applicant is chosen fairly and
          accurately. GRRR will form a small, confidential panel to review the
          applications. If there is no clear candidate, GRRR reserves the right
          to either extend the deadline or postpone the fund until there is a
          suitable applicant. All work submitted will remain confidential and
          not disclosed to third parties.
